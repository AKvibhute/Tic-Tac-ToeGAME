# Tic-Tac-Toe GAME 
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! Here's a detailed guide to how the game works:

Initial Interface
In the initial interface, you will see options to select the number of players. You can choose between playing solo against the computer (1 player) or competing against a friend (2 players). The screen for this selection looks like the image below:

Player Selection
1 Player: Choose this if you want to play against the computer.
2 Players: Choose this if you want to play against another person.
Main Game Interface
Once you have made your selection, you will be taken to the main game interface. This is where the actual game takes place. The board is a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in the empty squares. The main game interface looks like this:

Gameplay
1 Player Mode: You will play against the computer. The computer will take its turn after you make a move.
2 Player Mode: Two players will take turns making their moves. Player 1 is typically assigned X and Player 2 is assigned O.
Game End
After the game is over, the interface will evaluate the board to determine the outcome. It will announce the result as follows:

Win: If a player succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, that player is declared the winner. The game will then display a celebratory confetti blast.
Tie: If all squares are filled and no player has achieved three marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. The interface will notify the players of the tie.
The game end screen with the announcement and confetti blast looks like this:
